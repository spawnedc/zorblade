Music composed mainly for space shooter games. It haves a 90s house music style mixed with synth music of the 80s.
You can find short loopeable melodies with about 1:30 / 2:00 minutes of duration.

Originally this music was composed for a Android game called "Sky Strike Force", now erased from store. The licence of my music allows you to a free use for any other game.
